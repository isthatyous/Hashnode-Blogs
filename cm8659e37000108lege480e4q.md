When managing cloud instances in AWS, running out of disk space can become a challenge. With **Logical Volume Management (LVM)**, you can dynamically resize your storage without downtime. This guide will walk you through increasing disk space dynamically on a Linux instance in AWS.

Prerequisites

* A Linux-based EC2 instance running **LVM**.
    
* Root or sudo privileges.
    
* An additional EBS volume or the ability to resize an existing one.
    

## Step 1: Attach a New Volume (Optional)

If you need to add a new disk to your EC2 instance, follow these steps:

### **1\. Create a New Volume**

1. Open the **AWS Management Console**.
    
2. Navigate to **EC2** → **Volumes** (inside **Elastic Block Store**).
    
3. Click **Create Volume** and set the following:
    
    * **Size**: (e.g., `10GB`)
        
    * **Type**: (`gp3`, `gp2`, etc.)
        
    * **Availability Zone**: **Must match your EC2 instance's zone**
        
4. Click **Create Volume**.
    

### **2\. Attach the Volume to Your EC2 Instance**

1. Select the newly created volume.
    
2. Click **Actions** → **Attach Volume**.
    
3. Choose your **EC2 instance** from the dropdown list.
    
4. Set the **Device Name** (e.g., `/dev/xvdf`).
    
5. Click **Attach**.
    

If you already have an existing volume and want to resize it, skip this step.

Here the Volume we have created are known as the Physical Volume.

Create 3 volume (vol1, vol2, vol3) in AWS and Attach it to the Instance.

## **Step 2: Connect to Your EC2 Instance**

SSH into your EC2 instance:

```bash
ssh -i "your-private-key.pem" ubuntu@your-ec2-ip
```

Switch to root:

```bash
sudo su
```

## **Step 3: Verify Attached Disks**

Run:

```bash
lsblk
```

Expected output:

```plaintext
pgsqlCopyEditNAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0   20G  0 disk /
xvdf    202:1    0   10G  0 disk
xvdg    202:2    0   12G  0 disk
```

Here, `xvdf` and `xvdg` are the new volumes.

## **Step 4: Initialize Physical Volumes**

Before creating a volume group, we need to **initialize the physical volumes**:

```bash
pvcreate /dev/xvdf /dev/xvdg /dev/xvdh
```

Verify:

```bash
pvs
```

You should see output like:

```plaintext
bashCopyEditPV         VG     Fmt  Attr PSize  PFree
/dev/xvdf             lvm2 ---  10.00g 10.00g
/dev/xvdg             lvm2 ---  12.00g 12.00g
```

## **Step 5: Create a Volume Group**

Now, we combine both volumes (`xvdf` and `xvdg`) into a **single volume group**:

```bash
vgcreate my_vg /dev/xvdf /dev/xvdg
```

Verify:

```bash
vgs
```

Expected output:

```plaintext
VG    #PV #LV #SN Attr   VSize  VFree
my_vg   2   0   0 wz--n- 22.00g 22.00g
```

## **Step 6: Create a Logical Volume**

Now, we create a **10GB logical volume** within the volume group:

```bash
lvcreate -L 10G -n my_lv my_vg
```

Verify:

```bash
lvdisplay
```

Expected output:

```plaintext
--- Logical volume ---
LV Path                /dev/my_vg/my_lv
LV Name                my_lv
VG Name                my_vg
LV Size                10.00 GiB
```

## **Step 7: Format and Mount the Logical Volume**

1. **Create a filesystem on the logical volume**:
    
    ```bash
    mkfs.ext4 /dev/my_vg/my_lv
    ```
    
2. **Create a mount point**:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir /mnt/my_mount
    ```
    
3. **Mount the logical volume**:
    
    ```bash
    mount /dev/my_vg/my_lv /mnt/my_mount
    ```
    
4. **Verify**:
    
    ```bash
    df -h
    ```
    
    Output:
    
    ```plaintext
    Filesystem                Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/my_vg/my_lv          10G  40M  9.9G  1%  /mnt/my_mount
    ```
    
    Since you have **a 10GB logical volume (LV) created from a 22GB volume group (VG)** and **12GB of free space**, you can **extend the LV by 5GB** using the following steps:
    
    If your **logical volume (LV) is running out of space**, you can **dynamically increase it by 5GB** without downtime. Follow these steps:
    

## **Step 1: Verify Available Free Space in the Volume Group**

Run the following command to check the available free space in your volume group (`my_vg`):

```bash
vgs
```

Example output:

```plaintext
VG    #PV #LV #SN Attr   VSize  VFree
my_vg   2   1   0 wz--n- 22.00g  12.00g
```

Since **VFree is 12GB**, we can proceed to extend the LV by 5GB.

---

## **Step 2: Extend the Logical Volume**

Increase your logical volume (`my_lv`) by **5GB**:

```bash
lvextend -L +5G /dev/my_vg/my_lv
```

Verify the new size:

```bash
lvdisplay
```

---

## **Step 3: Resize the Filesystem**

Now, you need to resize the filesystem to recognize the new space.

* **For ext4 filesystem**, run:
    
    ```bash
    resize2fs /dev/my_vg/my_lv
    ```
    
* **For xfs filesystem**, run:
    
    ```bash
    xfs_growfs /mnt/my_mount
    ```
    

---

## **Step 4: Confirm the New Disk Space**

Run the following command to check the updated space:

```bash
df -h
```

Expected output:

```plaintext
Filesystem                Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/my_vg-my_lv   15G  2.0G  13G   10%  /mnt/my_mount
```

To **unmount** `/mnt/my_mount`, use:

```plaintext
sudo umount /mnt/my_mount
```

If you unmount, then data inside that volume will not be deleted, It can be accessed again by re-mounting it.

---

## Now **mounting a 14GB physical volume (PV3) directly to a Hard disk**

### **Step 1: Create a Mount Point**

```bash
 mkdir -p /mnt/disk_mount
```

### **Step 2: Format the Disk with ext4 Filesystem**

```bash
mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdh
```

* formating for disk is something different than Logical Volume formating
    
* `-t ext4`: Specifies the **ext4** filesystem type.
    

### **Step 3: Mount the Disk**

```bash
mount /dev/xvdh /mnt/disk_mount
```

### **Step 4: Verify the Mount**

```bash
df -h | grep /mnt/disk_mount
```
