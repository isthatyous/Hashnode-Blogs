Jira is a comprehensive project management tool that enables teams to create, track issues, manage sprints, and collaborate seamlessly. It offers a customizable workflow to accommodate different team structures and work processes. Jira is widely used in software development, IT service management, and business project tracking.

### Agile Project Management

It is an iterative and flexible approch to manage Projects, primaraly used in software development . It focuses on continuous improvemet, customer feedback, and adaptive planning of rigid, long-term plans.

Popular Agile Frame Works :

1. Scrum
    
2. Kanban
    
3. Lean
    
4. SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)
    

## Epic, Story, Task

In simple terms :

* **Epic** â†’ A big feature or goal that takes a long time to complete.
    
    Example: "Build a real estate platform."
    
* **Story** â†’ A smaller part of an epic that delivers a specific function.
    
    Example: "Allow users to list properties."
    
* **Task** â†’ A tiny piece of work needed to complete a story.
    
    Example: "Create the property listing form UI."
    

### **Epic :**

Learn Docker and Deploy a Containerized App

### **Stories :**

1. Understand Docker Basics.
    
2. Work with Docker Images & Containers.
    
3. Use Docker Compose for Multi-Container Apps.
    
4. Deploy a Dockerized App.
    

### **Tasks :**

ðŸ”¹ ***For Story 1 (Understand Docker Basics):***

* Install Docker on your system
    
* Learn basic Docker commands (`docker run`, `docker ps`, `docker stop`)
    
* Understand Dockerfile and how to create an image
    

ðŸ”¹ ***For Story 2 (Work with Docker Images & Containers):***

* Pull and run a pre-built Docker image
    
* Create your own Dockerfile and build a custom image
    
* Push your image to Docker Hub
    

ðŸ”¹ ***For Story 3 (Use Docker Compose for Multi-Container Apps):***

* Write a `docker-compose.yml` file
    
* Connect a Node.js app with a database using Docker Compose
    
* Start and stop containers with `docker-compose up/down`
    

ðŸ”¹ ***For Story 4 (Deploy a Dockerized App):***

* Set up a production-ready Dockerfile
    
* Deploy a containerized app to AWS/GCP/VPS
    
* Use Docker logs and debugging tools
    

Each **Epic** is a big goal, **Stories** are smaller steps, and Tasks are the actionable work items to achieve the goal.

### Story point :

To estimate the effort and complexity, time required to complete a task.  
In User story a small task get fewer points and a complex one get more.

### **Example:**

**"Add a login page"** â†’ **2 Story Points** (Easy)  
**"Integrate third-party payment system"** â†’ **8 Story Points** (Hard)  
**"Build a real-time chat system"** â†’ **13 Story Points** (Very Hard)

### Scrum Board :

A **Scrum Board** is a visual tool that helps teams track work in a project. It has columns like:

**TO Do** â†’ task that eed to be done.

**In progress** â†’ task currently being working on.

**Done** â†’ completed task

You can also add additional phases like Testing ( for code testing ) and so on.

### How to Manage project :

#### **Step 1: Create an Epic (Main Goal)**

1. In the navbar, click the **"Create"** button.
    
2. A dialog box will appear.
    
    * Choose **Issue Type** as **"Epic"**.
        
    * Add a **summary** (e.g., "Learn Docker").
        
    * Check the **status** and add a **description**.
        
3. **Add assignee** (select the team member responsible).
    
4. **Add label** and choose the **team** (create a new team if needed).
    
5. **Select the start date** and attach any files if required.
    

#### **Step 2: Create a Story**

* Follow the same steps as creating an Epic, but:
    
    * Change **Issue Type** to **"Story"**.
        
    * Two important options:
        
        1. **Select sprint** (choose the relevant sprint).
            
        2. **Set story point estimate** (assign effort points).
            

#### **Step 3: Create a Task**

* Same as Story, but:
    
    * Change **Issue Type** to **"Task"**.
        
    * Select the **sprint** you're working on.
        
    * Set a **story point estimate**.
        

#### **Workflow Management**

* After completing these steps, tasks will appear in the **"To Do"** section.
    
* To start work, **drag the task ticket** to the **"In Progress"** section.
    
* Move tasks to further stages (e.g., "Review," "Done") as they progress.
    
* ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1742898352484/9f6d70db-0526-477b-8a6c-02acdd3e63b8.png align="center")
    

### **Ticket in Jira?**

* A **ticket (or issue)** in Jira represents a single unit of work (task, bug, feature, etc.).
    
* Each ticket has:
    
    * **Unique Ticket ID** (e.g., `PROJ-123`) for tracking.
        
    * **Type** (Epic, Story, Task, Bug, etc.).
        
    * **Assignee** (person responsible).
        
    * **Status** (To Do, In Progress, Done, etc.).
        
    * **Priority** (High, Medium, Low).
        

In the left hand side you willl see lots of option click on the Backlog

### Backlog :

A **Backlog** is a to-do list for a project. It contains all the tasks (stories, bugs, features) that need to be done but haven't started yet.

I have a task to install Jenkins but I need to complete this task only after finishing my Docker task. This way, I can keep my task in the backlog as a reminder that it needs to be completed later.

## Jira + Slack Integration

### Follow these steps to integrate Jira with Slack and manage tasks efficiently:

#### **Step 1: Create a Slack Account**

* Sign up for a **Slack account** if you donâ€™t have one.
    
* Inside Slack, go to your **workspace**. If you donâ€™t have a workspace, create one and launch Slack.
    

#### **Step 2: Install the Jira Cloud App for Slack**

* In Jira, go to the **Navbar** and click on **Apps**.
    
* Select **Explore more apps** and search for **Jira Cloud for Slack** (choose the most downloaded version).
    
* Alternatively, you can navigate to:
    
    * **Project â†’ Quick Start â†’ Connect Your Tools â†’ Choose Slack**.
        

#### **Step 3: Connect Jira to Slack**

* Click on **Get App** â†’ **Learn More** â†’ **Allow the integration** â†’ **Go to Slack**.
    
* You will now see **Jira** inside the **Apps** section in Slack.
    

#### **Step 4: Create a Jira Task from Slack**

* Open **Slack** and go to the **Jira bot message**. (you can refer the Image below)
    
* Type `/jira create task` in the chat.
    
* Fill in the required details.
    
* Click **Submit**, and the task will be created in Jira.
    

A new task will get created and get saved in the backlog you can check it out there.

## **Why Integrate Jira and GitHub? (Simple Explanation)**

Integrating **Jira and GitHub** helps developers and project managers work together smoothly. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Track Progress Easily** â†’ When you push code or create a pull request in GitHub, Jira updates the related task automatically.
    
2. **Better Collaboration** â†’ Developers can see which Jira issues are linked to their code changes.
    
3. **Faster Workflow** â†’ No need to switch between Jira and GitHub to update task status manually.
    
4. **Automated Updates** â†’ Jira can move tasks from **"In Progress"** to **"Done"** when the code is merged.
    

## **Jira + GitHub Integration**

**Go to Project â†’ Quick Start â†’ Connect Your Tools â†’ Choose GitHub**

* Click **Continue â†’ Next**
    
* Grant **repository access**
    
* Once completed, your GitHub account will be connected to Jira
    
* ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1742900039046/98b4506a-f54d-41c7-ae3c-c8ab3cdd2b99.png align="center")
    

Now, go to your **Scrum Board** and click on any task ticket. Under the **Development** section, you will have the following options:

1. **Create Branch** â€“ Create a new branch in the linked GitHub repository directly from Jira.
    
2. **Create Commit** â€“ Commit changes to the repository from within Jira.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1742900339996/fe3abb6f-06fd-4cfc-97c8-c9bc682ec314.png align="center")

We know that every Jira ticket has a unique ID, such as **SCRUM-1, SCRUM-2**, etc.

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">Hereâ€™s a cool trick: when you push your code to GitHub, itâ€™s usually only visible in GitHub. But with Jira and GitHub integration, you can track your commits directly from Jira.</div>
</div>

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "added new feature - SCRUM -1" 
git push origin feature-branch
```

## How things Automation works in Jira :

Follow these steps to automate Slack notifications when an issue transitions in Jira:

#### **Step 1: Create an Automation Rule**

* Navigate to **Project Settings â†’ Automation â†’ Create Rule**.
    
* Jira provides various automation functions that you can use for Slack integration.
    

#### **Step 2: Set Up the Trigger**

* Choose the **Trigger**: **"When an issue is transitioned"**.
    
* Configure the transition details (e.g., from **Done** to **Progress**).
