This is one of the most beautiful pieces of software ever written. It made the internet what it is today because it gave a human-readable name to every single thing out there, eliminating the need to remember weird IP addresses of machines. This is how the entire DNS resolution process works.

We see how DNS resolves a domain name into its IP address. For us to connect to any machine on the internet, we need its IP address. Even in our browser, if we type **www.google.com**, our browser needs the IP address to establish the TCP/IP connection.

So obviously, on the backend side of the Google we would have a bunch of frontend servers who are responsible for serving google.com. These are the servers in which there code on Angular and whatever framework they are using as is there and these server are capable of serving the **home page of Google.** Obviously these backend servers are behind the load balancer . Assume this is a very simple architecture of the google because google has more complex than this . Assume that the ip of this load balancer is (17.54.21.253) which means this is the machine or IP address to which your browser will establish the connection when someones types in google.com

## How Does the Browser Know Which IP Address to Connect To?

Somewhere, this particular mapping needs to be stored that www.google.com means 17.53.21.253 .This is typically A or CNAME record in the dDNS configuration at Google, along with the other records like bard.google.com, etc

## DNS Zone

This configuration is done in something called a **DNS Zone**. Now, this zone is specific to **google.com**, where mappings are stored, such as:

* **www.google.com** → **17.54.21.253**
    
* **bard.google.com** → some load balancer CNAME
    
* Other records like MX, TXT, etc.
    

This configuration is done something called DNS zone. All DNS records of a domain are part of a **zone (a logical entity)**. This is the logical grouping of all the subdomains and DNS records for a particular domain. So, everything about **google.com** is in there. You might have multiple such zones for different domains that you own.

Given this logical entity, this mapping needs to be served from some server. These servers are called **authoritative name servers**.

## Authoritative Name Servers

An **authoritative name server** hosts multiple zones and it answer DNS queries for the zones it owns . Its responsibility is preitty simple: given a request for a zone that it owns, it needs to respond with the record against it.

For example, I have this pink zone represents the google.com zone. There are three name servers responsible for serving it. So when a request for google.com comes into one of these name serverss,Since it own the zone it would go read the key value pair ,get the value send it back . So **authoritative name servers** are the ones which zones are hosted and given a request would send the response for the corresponding value

This way, if someone reaches out to these namseserver directly, asking that “Hey, I want to connect to www .google.com; where should i go?” they can provide the correct IP address because they own the zones.

These name servers typically look like ns1.gns.com or aws.dns.net . Thses are the name servers that we typically configure when we purchasing a domain on **Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.**.. The default name servers are the **GoDaddy name servers** or **Namecheap name servers**—the name servers on which zones are hosted. However, you can obviously change the name servers. For example, if you buy a domain from **GoDaddy**, you can choose to use **AWS name servers** to manage DNS through **Route53**.

## How Do We Reach These Name Servers?

We reached to the point that if we somehow know the authoritative namse server name, given a request it would give the record, I was looking for.

### Option 1: Centralized Approach

One option could be to have a single gigantic server that everybody reaches out to when they want information. However, this **centralized approach is not scalable, fault-tolerant, or even manageable** due to the sheer amount of reads, writes, and the volume of data that needs to be handled.

### Option 2: Decentralized Approach

A **decentralized approach** means no single machine knows everything.

## DNS Resolver

Now that we know how to reach authoritative name servers, the **DNS resolver** is a server that carries out the resolution of a domain to an IP address.

### Where Does It Run?

A DNS resolver can run in multiple places, but it typically runs at the **ISP level**. Let's say you are using **ACT Internet** as your ISP. When the request goes to the ACT backbone, the server handling it would perform the resolution for you. Your browser typically does not handle it.

Alternatively, on your home internet, even your **router** is capable of doing DNS resolution. The router also **caches DNS records** that it gets from various servers so that it does not need to resolve them repeatedly. However, you can change your DNS resolver to popular ones like:

* **Google: 8.8.8.8**
    
* **Cloudflare: 1.1.1.1**
    

### What Happens at the DNS Resolver Level?

At the DNS resolver level, when a request is made:

1. If the DNS resolver already has the IP address for the domain, it sends it back.
    
2. If not, it performs the entire resolution process, caches the IP address, and sends the response to the user.
    

## How Does DNS Resolution Work?

Now, assuming there is **no caching at any layer**r. So what does the very crude process looks like say, if you are looking for www.google.com your browser needs to somehow establish TCP connection with the IP 17.253.4.12. Request from the browser went to the router , assume that your router is doing the DNS resolution part for you, the router will talk to the root name server. In the world there are total exactly 13 root name server doesn’t mean 13 physical server. It mean there are 13 fixed IP addresss which are my root name server IP address, the key thing is that although it is fixed address for each root nameserver that doesn’t mean there are exactly 1 physical server for that root namseserver they are many. All of them are distributed accross the world and they all advertise the same IP address using anycast.

## **Which organizations operate these 13 root dns servers?**

The operation of the 13 root DNS servers is a collaborative effort among several organizations under contract with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). These organizations are known as the Root Zone Maintainer (RZM) organizations and include:

1. Verisign, Inc. (operates two root servers, labeled A and J)
    
2. University of Southern California, Information Sciences Institute (operates root server D)
    
3. Cogent Communications (operates root server M)
    
4. University of Maryland (operates root server G)
    
5. Internet Systems Consortium, Inc. (operates root server F)
    
6. NASA Ames Research Center (operates root server E)
    
7. U.S. Department of Defense Network Information Center (operates root server B)
    
8. Naval Research Laboratory (operates root server C)
    
9. Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) (operates root server H)
    
10. Netnod Internet Exchange AB (operates root server I)
    
11. RIPE NCC (Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre) (operates root server K)
    
12. Information Technology and Network Services (IT&NS) of the University of Tokyo (operates root server L)
    
13. National Internet Exchange of India (NIXI) (operates root server N)
    

These organizations work together to ensure that the root DNS servers are maintained and operated in a reliable and secure manner, and that the global DNS system continues to function smoothly.

The beauty of this is that whenever any machine tries to resolve [`www.google.com`](http://www.google.com), it will contact one of the 13 root name server IPs, which are hardcoded. Rather than reaching a specific root name server at random, the request is routed to the nearest physical server broadcasting the same IP using Anycast. This ensures that the incoming request connects to the closest available root server. Once the request reaches the nearest root server, it responds with the IP address of another server responsible for handling the `.com` top-level domain (TLD), since we are looking for [`google.com`](http://google.com).

So, for every top level domain there are lot of server that handles them when queried for Domain name it respond with IP address of some TDL (eg .com,.in.edu etc ) each root namserver is owned by Company or Institute.

## Every time anyone requessting or accessing website all the request go to the root name servers ?

Not Really here your Browser and OS do a lot of caching for us. Root nam server have fixed IP addresses and even if lets i get IP for TLD .com my machine can cache it because how often it would change.

The process looks very simple. Let's say your router or ISP is doing DNS resolution for you. It first talks to the root nameserver, which spits out the IP address of the machine that owns the .com TLD. So, it goes to that machine, and it responds to the authoritative nameserver that is configured, i.e, [ns1.gns.com](http://ns1.gns.com), which internally goes to the authoritative way that owns that zone, [google.com](http://google.com). It looks at the value against [www.google.com](http://www.google.com) and responds. Then your DNS resolver gets it, spits it out to the browser, and then the browser establishes a connection with this IP, 17.53.21.253, which is your Load Balancer IP address. Then, the load balancer forwards the request to one of the backend servers or the frontend server and responds with the HTML.
